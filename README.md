# Team Turing Distributed Caching Service Architecture

## Overview

This architecture diagram illustrates a Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) namespace setup for a distributed caching service managed by Team Turing. It involves various components like load balancers, Redis for caching, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and Tiller for deployment automation. Below is a detailed breakdown of each component and their interactions.

## Components Breakdown

### Load Balancer
- **Function:** Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple pods to ensure no single pod is overwhelmed.
- **Flow:** Receives application flow from TP 2 (presumably a traffic provider or client) and forwards it to the appropriate pod via Cluster IP.

### Cluster IP
- **Function:** Acts as a virtual IP to load balance the traffic to the service pods within the cluster.
- **Flow:** Receives traffic from the Load Balancer and directs it to the appropriate pod based on the service discovery mechanism.

### Ingress
- **Function:** Manages external access to the services in the cluster, typically through HTTP and HTTPS.
- **Flow:** Handles HTTP traffic to and from the Redis Engineer, allowing for external management and monitoring.

### Redis
- **Components:**
  - **Redis v5.x:** The primary caching layer.
  - **Redis Metrics Exporter:** Exports Redis metrics to Prometheus for monitoring.
- **Flow:** Receives application flow and interacts with Prometheus to export metrics.

### Prometheus
- **Version:** v2.4.3
- **Function:** Collects and stores metrics from various components for monitoring and alerting.
- **Flow:** Collects metrics from Redis and its metrics exporter and forwards alert data to Alert Manager.

### Grafana
- **Version:** v5.4.3
- **Function:** Visualizes the data collected by Prometheus.
- **Flow:** Receives HTTP traffic from Prometheus and displays it in a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring.

### Alert Manager
- **Version:** v0.16.1
- **Function:** Manages alerts sent by Prometheus, including deduplication, grouping, and routing.
- **Flow:** Receives alert data from Prometheus and manages alert notifications.

### Tiller
- **Version:** v2.11.0
- **Function:** Manages Helm package deployments within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Flow:** Interacts with the CaaS API for deployment automation and manages the deployment of various components like Redis, Prometheus, Grafana, and Alert Manager.

### CaaS API
- **Function:** Provides an interface for managing the deployment and scaling of containerized applications.
- **Flow:** Facilitates management and automation interactions, particularly with the Redis Engineer for HTTP traffic and management tasks.

### Storage (PVC)
- **Components:**
  - **AlertManager Persistent Volume**
  - **Grafana Persistent Volume**
  - **Prometheus Persistent Volume**
  - **Redis Persistent Volume**
- **Function:** Provides persistent storage for the stateful components to retain data across pod restarts and rescheduling.

## Interaction Flows

### Application Flow
- Begins from TP 2, passes through the Load Balancer, and is distributed to the appropriate services via Cluster IP.
- Redis processes the application data and interacts with Prometheus for metrics collection.

### Prometheus Flow
- Collects metrics from Redis and its exporter, forwarding this data to Alert Manager for alert processing.
- Sends HTTP traffic to Grafana for data visualization.

### Alert Manager Flow
- Manages alerts received from Prometheus, ensuring that alerts are appropriately routed and managed.

### Management and Automation
- Redis Engineer interacts with the CaaS API for management tasks, facilitated by Ingress for HTTP traffic.
- Tiller manages deployment automation by interacting with the CaaS API and deploying the necessary components to their respective persistent volumes.

## Example Scenario: User Login with Session Caching

Let's consider a practical example where this system is used to manage user login sessions for a web application.

### User Login Request
- A user attempts to log in to the web application, sending a login request to the application server.

### Routing to Redis
- The application server sends this request through the Load Balancer, which directs it to one of the Redis instances via the Cluster IP.

### Session Management in Redis
- Redis checks if the user's session already exists. If not, it creates a new session entry and stores the user's session data, such as user ID, authentication token, and session expiration time.
- The session data is stored in-memory for quick access.

### Metrics Collection
- Redis Metrics Exporter collects metrics related to this transaction, such as request count, response time, and memory usage, and exports these to Prometheus.

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Prometheus continuously monitors Redis metrics. If any metric exceeds predefined thresholds (e.g., high memory usage or slow response time), it sends an alert to the Alert Manager.
- The Alert Manager processes and routes this alert to the appropriate channels (e.g., notifying the Redis Engineer via email or a messaging platform).

### Dashboard Visualization
- Grafana visualizes the metrics collected by Prometheus, displaying them on a dashboard. Engineers can see real-time data on login requests, Redis performance, and any active alerts.

### External Management
- The Redis Engineer can access the system through the Ingress, using the CaaS API for management tasks such as scaling Redis instances or updating configurations.
- Tiller automates deployment and scaling processes, ensuring that the Redis service adapts to changing loads.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates how the distributed caching service handles user login requests, manages session data, and ensures system performance and reliability through continuous monitoring and alerting. The architecture supports scalability, high availability, and robust management, making it well-suited for demanding web applications requiring efficient caching solutions.
